How to download SC2 replays?

You can find a large replay pack [here](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#replay-packs) (for SC2 3.16.1). It contains hundreds of thousands of replays.

But it is not the replays that have version >= 4.0. To find some replays of newer SC2 versions, try to use the download replays method (can download different versions of replays).

The tutorial is here. But we also present them in mini-AlphaStar (in scripts/download_replay/third).

For Chinese users who are not convenient to use Battle.net (outside China), try to use the [Guide](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/410523216) at Zhihu (in Chinese). It will teach you how to use the user client of the Battle.net (China server) to download replays placed at the Battle.net (US server).

If you find any questions or problems, please open an issue and we can discuss it.
